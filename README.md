## Prerequisites
These workflows can be run on any Unix-based system. 

### Installations
* The Ansible control machine must have **Python3.5+** and at least **Ansible 2.9** installed. See [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for more information on Ansible installation.

* This project requires the AOS-CX Ansible Collection to be installed. The easiest way to install the collection is by executing the `ansible-galaxy` command on the `requirements.yml` file:  
`ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`  
For more information on how to use the [`aoscx` Collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/arubanetworks/aoscx) visit our [Aruba devHub](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/aruba-aoscx/docs/getting-started-with-ansible-and-aos-cx).

* This project requires the Python libraries listed below to be installed. The easiest way to install the required libraries is using the `pip` command on the `requirements.txt` file:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Inventory Setup
This project contains multiple inventories, each corresponding to a specific workflow. Which inventory files correspond to which workflows is described in the [Workflows](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows#workflows) section of this document. 

#### AOS-CX DCN Inventory Plugin
Typically users use YAML or INI formatted files to define their Ansible inventory and in this project we have multiple YAML inventory files that correspond to specific workflows. 
Also in this project you'll find an [Ansible inventory plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory.html), an inventory plugin allows you to specify a data source as your source for dynamically generating your inventory 
before executing each playbook. We've created the AOS-CX Data Center inventory plugin [`inventory_plugins/aoscx_dcn_plugin.py`](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_plugins/aoscx_dcn_plugin.py) 
which allows users to input data into an Excel file that Ansible will then use to configure devices.  

Each workflow has a specific Excel template that it uses to generate Ansible values, the Excel files found in [files/](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/tree/master/files) can be modified/renamed to match 
 your environment and specifications. Once your Excel file is defined, you simply need to specify the [aoscx_dcn_plugin](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_plugins/aoscx_dcn_plugin.py), the 
 directory containing the Excel file, and the name of the Excel file you want to use in your Ansible YAML inventory file like so:  
```yaml
plugin: aoscx_dcn_plugin           # Name of the plugin
path_to_inventory: ./files # Directory location of Excel
excel_file: dedicated_two_tier_DCN_Settings.xlsx # Name of the Excel
``` 
 
Using this inventory plugin in an inventory file with a playbook is exactly the same, just provide the YAML file with the `-i` option:  
`ansible-playbook deploy_2tier_dedicated_datacenter.yml -i dynamic_2tier_dedicated_dc_inventory.yml`
  
#### Making The Inventory Your Own
In this project we have the option of using either the YAML inventory file to define your environment through variables **or** use the 
[aoscx_dcn_plugin](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_plugins/aoscx_dcn_plugin.py) in combination with an Excel template. 
Either approach works with the provided playbooks, but you should use one or the other.  
  
Each inventory provided is made to be an example. You are encouraged to change IP addressing and interface values to match your environment. 
Note that these inventories use a logical grouping method of to group VSX Pairs and assumes that each VSX pair of access/leaf switches is in a group. 
The names of these groups can be any alphanumeric name; this is just one approach to coupling VSX pairs. 
You can change the "rack#" nomenclature in the example inventory files to your liking as long as you keep the names consistent throughout the inventory.  

#### aoscx_dcn_plugin + Excel Templates
Each workflow has an Excel template to use in [files/](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/tree/master/files), 
which Excel file corresponds to which workflow is described in the [Workflows](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows#workflows) section of this document. 
Cells in the Excel file that are protected are used by the 
[aoscx_dcn_plugin](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_plugins/aoscx_dcn_plugin.py) to generate/populate variables to be later used in the playbooks, cells that have sample data are for you to 
change/modify to make your own. In the event that it's required to unprotect the sheets in the workbook, use the password **aruba** to unlock the sheets.  
* Cells you **should not** change:  
![Protected Cells](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/files/images/protected_cells1.PNG?raw=true)
![Protected Cells](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/files/images/protected_cells2.PNG?raw=true)  
  
* Cells you **should** change:  
![Value Cells](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/files/images/value_cells1.PNG?raw=true)
![Value Cells](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/files/images/value_cells2.PNG?raw=true)  

  
In addition to populating variables used in Ansible, this plugin will also dynamically generate IP addressing for Loopback Addresses and Fabric Addresses (where applicable) based on values entered in the Network sheet of the Excel template. 
If you'd like to specify device's interface loopback0 IP address, specify a value for the device's Loopback Interface 0 IP Address cell and enter the value "N/A" for Loopback Addresses in the Network sheet. 
If you'd like to specify the fabric addressing for the Spine Leaf workflows, it's recommended to use the YAML inventory file method instead of the Excel template.


#### YAML Inventory File  
All the variables in the inventory files are necessary for the workflows to run. There are three broad categories of variables:
1. Some variables are static, such as the AOS-CX Ansible connection variables. These variables maintain constant values that should not be changed.
1. Some variables' values necessarily must be changed to match device information for your specific environment.
1. Some variables have default values that can be changed. Changing these is optional. 

Before executing a workflow, look through the inventory file used by that workflow, and change any variable values that must be changed, and also any variables you would like to change. 

* Examples of static inventory variables that **should not** be changed:
```YAML
ansible_connection: arubanetworks.aoscx.aoscx   # DO NOT CHANGE
ansible_network_os: arubanetworks.aoscx.aoscx   # DO NOT CHANGE
ansible_httpapi_use_ssl: True   # DO NOT CHANGE
config_template: leaf.j2
```

* Examples of inventory variables that **need** to be changed:
```YAML
ansible_host: 10.10.10.56 # IP address of the switch, change to match devices in your environment
server_vlans: [11]    # VLANs to be created on leafs for server traffic
core_mclag_uplink_ports: ['1/1/49', '1/1/50'] # Interfaces that will be a part of the MCLAG connecting access device to core
vsx_keepalive_int: 1/1/31
vsx_isl_ports: ['1/1/32']
```

* Examples of inventory variables that **can** be changed, but have default values that work:
```YAML
spine_L3fabric_ips:
  - 192.168.2.1
  - 192.168.2.3
  - 192.168.2.5
  - 192.168.2.7
loopback0_ip: 192.168.1.1
loopback1_ip: 192.168.100.1  
```


## Workflows

#### Files Used
* Playbook : [deploy_campus_attached_dc_tor.yml](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/deploy_campus_attached_dc_tor.yml)  
* Inventory : 
  * YAML Inventory File : [inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml)
    * ***Note:** This inventory file is also used for the Architecture II workflow, so it contains additional information for access switches (Zone1-Rack<1/3>-Access<1/2/3/4>). 
    Valid values for variables relating to those devices are not necessary for this workflow.*  
  * Excel Template File : [campus_attached_dcToR_DCN_Settings.xlsx](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/files/campus_attached_dcToR_DCN_Settings.xlsx)  
* Jinja2 Templates : [templates/2Tier/core.j2](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/templates/2Tier/core.j2)  


#### Workflow Walkthrough
* **Prior to executing the Ansible playbook, the environment must be in this initial state:**
  * Zone1-Core<1a/1b> - These devices each have a default configuration with an IP address (DHCP/Static) assigned to the management interface. This IP address should match the value of [`ansible_host`](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L49) for each device in the inventory.
* The playbook will perform the following actions on every `core` device in the [inventory file](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L77), using SSH:
  1. Generate a configuration based on the template file [templates/2Tier/core.j2](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/templates/2Tier/core.j2) and values defined in the inventory
  1. Push the generated configuration to the device using the AOS-CX Ansible **SSH** module `aoscx_config`
  1. Enable 10g speed interface groups (if defined in the [inventory](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L76)) 
 using the AOS-CX Ansible **SSH** module `aoscx_config`
  1. Create [VSX Keepalive](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L33) L3 Interface
  1. Create [VSX Inter-switch link](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L34-L35)
  1. Configure [VSX attributes](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L46-L48) on the switch and specify device role as outlined in the [inventory](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L51)
  1. Create all VLANs defined as `server_vlans` in the [inventory](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L27)
  1. Create SVIs for all VLANs defined as `core_vlan_interfaces` in the [inventory](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L107-L111)
  1. Configure the multi-chassis LAGs that connect to each access switch and trunk the VLANs in [`trunk_vlans`](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml#L92).
     * **Note:** `vsx_pair_mclags` is a list of VSX Pair (rack# grouping) information for the core devices to use for configuring downlink interfaces. You should modify these values appropriately to match your environment.
  
  1. Configure BGP neighbor for iBGP peering between the core switches    

* For example final configurations for this workflow, see [configs/sample_configs/arch1](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/configs/sample_configs/arch1)
  
**Because of path requirements, you must run this workflow from the root level of the cloned repository:**  
`ansible-playbook deploy_campus_attached_dc_tor.yml -i inventory_2tier_dedicated_dc.yml`
  
    
### Architecture II - Dedicated Data Center Two-Tier
This workflow provisions a VSX pair of switches acting as a centralized collapsed Data Center core 
 and campus attached access AOS-CX switches in VSX pairs based on the [validated reference design](https://community.arubanetworks.com/t5/Data-Center-Networking-Solutions/Deploying-a-2-Tier-DC-Network-with-NetEdit/ta-p/556403).

#### Workflow Walkthrough
* **Before the Ansible playbook will be executed, the environment is in this initial state:**
  * Zone1-Spine<1/2> + Zone1-Rack1-Leaf<1a/1b> + Zone1-Rack3-Leaf<3a/3b> - These devices have a default configuration with an IP address (DHCP/Static) assigned to 
the management interface, this IP address should be the value of [`ansible_host`](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_spine_leaf.yml#L59) for each device in the inventory.  
  * Zone1-Rack1-Leaf<1a/1b> - These devices are in a VSX pair with their physical links matching the values defined in the [inventory](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_spine_leaf.yml#L32-L34)
  * Zone1-Rack3-Leaf<3a/3b> - These devices are in a VSX pair with their physical links matching the values defined in the [inventory](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_spine_leaf.yml#L32-L34) 
* The playbook will perform the following actions on **every** device in the [inventory file](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_spine_leaf.yml) 
using **SSH**:
  1. Generate a configuration based on the template file [templates/eBGP/spine.j2](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/templates/eBGP/spine.j2) or [templates/eBGP/leaf.j2](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/templates/eBGP/leaf.j2)  
 and values defined in the inventory
  1. Push the generated configuration to the device using the AOS-CX SSH Ansible module `aoscx_config`
  1. Enable 10g speed interface groups (if defined in the [inventory](https://github.com/aruba/aoscx-ansible-dcn-workflows/blob/master/inventory_spine_leaf.yml#L116)
